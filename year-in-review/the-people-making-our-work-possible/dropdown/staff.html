<p>It takes a very talented and dedicated group of people to carry out the often challenging humanitarian work that Red Cross does every day. We are committed to supporting, engaging and retaining our staff and making our organisation a rewarding place to work.</p>

<p>In October 2014 we were proud to be the joint winners of the Indigenous Employment Award as part of the Australian Human Resources Institute (AHRI) Inclusion and Diversity Awards. Our commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities is expressed through a workforce which includes 149 talented and professional <a href="http://www.redcross.org.au/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-employment.aspx">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff</a> who know and understand their communities. This currently represents 6.2% percent of our total staff.*</p>

<p>Red Cross was a finalist in the AHRI Marshall Goldman Talent Management Awards for our workforce development plan, outlining our approach to developing staff and volunteers from 2013 to 2015. We were also recipients of the 2015 Compassionate Employer award from Compassionate Friends Victoria, which recognises organisations who provide outstanding support to staff following the death of a loved one.</p>

<p>Our organisation faced a major challenge this year in the transition of our <a href="http://www.redcross.org.au/migration-support.aspx">migration support programs</a> to a new government contract, resulting in the loss of many staff positions. Faced with this difficult situation, we implemented the change in a way that was clear, transparent, predictable and timely, ensuring appropriate support was available throughout.</p>

<p><em>*These figures relate to staff in our Humanitarian Services and exclude the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, which is managed separately.</em></p>

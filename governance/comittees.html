<p>The National Leadership Team supports the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in setting the strategic direction for the organisation, effectively managing day-to-day operations, implementing decisions of the Board and senior management, and providing leadership to Red Cross people.</p>

<p>The National Leadership Team held four face-to-face meetings in this financial year, and met by videoconference and teleconference in the months in between. Within this team, the former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Tickner; Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Chakravarty; Director of Services and International Operations, Michael Raper; and Director, Marketing, Fundraising and Communications, Jennifer Gibb attended Board meetings throughout the year. While not voting members, they make recommendations to the Board via papers put forward.</p>

<h2 id="australian-red-cross-blood-service-boardhttpwwwdonatebloodcomaucorporatecorporate-governanceblood-service-board"><a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/corporate/corporate-governance/blood-service-board">Australian Red Cross Blood Service Board</a></h2>
<p>The Australian Red Cross Blood Service is an operational arm of the Australian Red Cross Society. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service Board reports to the Australian Red Cross Board, which has overall responsibility and appoints all non-executive Board members. The Blood Service Board, which has general oversight of the management of the Blood Service and the CEO, comprises nine non-executive members who oversee the strategic direction, financial and operational activities, and risk management of the Blood Service. Australian Red Cross’ Deputy President and Chief Financial Officer are both Blood Service Board members.</p>

<h2 id="divisional-advisory-boardshttpwwwredcrossorgaustate-advisory-boardsaspx"><a href="http://www.redcross.org.au/state-advisory-boards.aspx">Divisional Advisory Boards</a></h2>
<p>The Divisional Advisory Boards have a number of functions under our divisional regulations, in connection with their advisory, divisional governance, promotion and communications roles.</p>

<h2 id="legal-and-policy-unit">Legal and Policy Unit</h2>
<p>Headed by General Counsel Bruce Moore, the Legal and Policy Unit provides independent in-house legal advice and representation for the Society on legal aspects of policy, operational and governance matters. It also coordinates the provision of support by external legal advisers.</p>

<h2 id="australian-charities-and-not-for-profits-commissionhttpwwwacncgovau"><a href="http://www.acnc.gov.au/">Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission</a></h2>
<p>In December 2012, Australian Red Cross Society became a registered charity with the newly formed Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), which is the independent national regulator of charities.</p>

<p>Governance standards have been established under the ACNC legislation, which came into effect from 1 July 2013. These are similar to the duties previously applicable under the Corporations Act 2001.</p>
